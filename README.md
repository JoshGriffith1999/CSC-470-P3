Hi Dr. Bishop, for a quick reference, when i created the original solution I accidently created a Windows form for .Net Core 3.1 instead of creating one for .NET Framework 4.7.2.
So, I had to go, create the correct Web Apps and bring all the code from the incorrect version over to the correct one.
I pushed the incorrect version over to the Old-Version branch, or something to that nature.
I then went and pushed the correct version here to the main branch.
Everyone did contribute to the creating of the project, the commit history should tell enough.
If there is any confusion over what is going on, let me know and I can try and clear up as much as possible.
I just do not want Nick or Luke to get screwed out of points.
